### Lab 11 -  Intro to MVC & Core
 
 In this assignment we are creating a web app that will allow a user to put in a span of two different years, and a list of all the winners will be returned. 


## Challenge

Build a web app from an empty template to allow users to to make queries to search for Time's person of the year.

##Approach & Efficiency 

Build a web app that has an time range for the Time persons of the year from 1927 to 2016. This file would allow a user to make a range selection. Once the selection is made,
a list of these people will be dssplayed on a results page.  

##Solution 
Create an input field tha allows a user to make a selection of a range of years. A csv file contains the persons of the year. The query will pull the persons of the year
from the csv file and display them on a results page.


##Here are images of the serch menu and the results from the query.
